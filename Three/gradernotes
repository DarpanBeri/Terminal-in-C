I believe everything works perfectly under all conditions
I wrote the p3helper.c code myself

My algorithm for p3helper.c is very heavily inspired by the Reader-Writer problem.

The basic concept is as follows:

        1. Whether you are a jogger or a shooter, you get access to your registry. Get yourself counted (jogger_count or shooter_count), revoke access to the registry and then you are allowed you go in the gym.
        2. There is a special case where in, if you are the first of your group to enter the gym, you block the gym access for other group.
        3. When leaving the gym, you get access to your registry, remove yourself from the count, revoke access to the registry.
        4. There is a special case where in, if you are the last of your groiup to leave the gym, you unblok the gym access for other group.

Overall Explanation:

        Gobal variables: 
        * Semaphores jogger, shooter and gym_floor
        * Integer jogger_count and shooter_count

        I used the Semaphores as a "registry" of tracking who is or is not in the gym.

Algorithm:

        For entering the gym:
                if(kind == JOGGER){
                        
                                Check if gym floor occupied or not
                                Grant access to jogger's "registry"
                                jogger_count = jogger_count + 1;
                                If first jogger, block access to gym_floor for shooters
                                Revoke access to jogger's "registry"
                Vice Versa for Shooters,

        For leaving the gym:

                if(kind == JOGGER){
                                
                                // Joggers jogged, now they want to leave
                                
                                Grant access to jogger's "registry"
                                jogger_count = jogger_count - 1;
                                If last jogger, allow shooters to access the gym_floor
                                Revoke access to jogger's "registry"
                Vice Versa for Shooters
